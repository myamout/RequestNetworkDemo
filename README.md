# Request Network Demo
Demo using simple node scripts to run the Request Network JS Library
* Forked from the Request Team's JS Library repository on Github

# NOTE
- It seems that there are some issues with Web3 at the moment so it's hard to use the
    library as of now. I'm trying to find a work around or some downgraded version that works. Will update the README here if a fix is found.

# Installation
- Run `npm i` in the root directory
- Run `npm i -g ganache-cli` to get the Ganache Testrpc to run a local test         
    blockchain

# Running Testrpc
- Run `npm run ganache` to start up the Testrpc

# Deploying Contracts
- Run `npm run testdeploy` to deploy the Request Network smart contracts to the Testrpc. Remember to run this from another terminal window.

# Running Node Scripts
- Scripts currently in the works.
